Hi! You seem to want to add your custom scripts to the menu? I'm gonna show you exactly how to do just that!

Right, first step. Add your script (whether it be in python or some other language (NOTE: As we made the project in python, we didn't test it against other languages apart from batch))to the /main folder. Your scripts to run on Windows via a shell of some sort goes into the "windows_stuff" folder, whilst all other Linux-based tools will just go into the main folder folder.

After you've done the above, you are going to have to modify the main.py script.
